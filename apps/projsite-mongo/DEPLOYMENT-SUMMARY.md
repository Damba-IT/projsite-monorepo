# Vercel Deployment Summary

## What We've Done

1. **Created Vercel Configuration**:
   - Added `vercel.json` with Node.js runtime configuration
   - Set up routing to direct all requests to the API handler

2. **Created API Handler**:
   - Added `api/index.js` that imports the built app and uses `@hono/node-server/vercel`
   - Configured it to disable body parsing (handled by Hono)

3. **Updated Build Configuration**:
   - Modified the build script to target Node.js instead of Bun
   - Added external dependencies to handle shared packages
   - Created a vercel-build script for Vercel to use

4. **Updated App Structure**:
   - Exported the app as both default and named export for compatibility
   - Added `@hono/node-server` as a dependency

5. **Added Documentation**:
   - Created a VERCEL.md guide with deployment instructions
   - Added this summary document

## Current Status

The code is ready for deployment to Vercel. We've successfully:
- Built the app targeting Node.js
- Created the necessary Vercel-specific files
- Installed the required dependencies

## Next Steps

1. **Complete Vercel Project Setup**:
   ```bash
   # From the projsite-mongo directory
   vercel link
   ```
   - Select the appropriate scope
   - Create a new project or link to an existing one

2. **Set Environment Variables in Vercel**:
   - MONGODB_URI
   - CLERK_SECRET_KEY
   - CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY
   - NODEJS_HELPERS=0

3. **Deploy to Vercel**:
   ```bash
   # From the projsite-mongo directory
   vercel
   ```

4. **Monitor Deployment**:
   - Check logs for any issues
   - Verify API endpoints are working correctly

5. **Set Up Production Domain**:
   - Configure custom domain if needed
   - Set up proper CORS settings for production

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

1. **Build Failures**:
   - Check that all dependencies are properly installed
   - Ensure the build script is correctly targeting Node.js
   - Verify the API handler is properly importing the built app

2. **Runtime Errors**:
   - Check environment variables are properly set
   - Verify MongoDB connection string is correct
   - Check CORS settings if facing cross-origin issues

3. **Monorepo-Specific Issues**:
   - If dependencies between packages aren't resolving, check the build externals
   - Ensure shared packages are being properly bundled
